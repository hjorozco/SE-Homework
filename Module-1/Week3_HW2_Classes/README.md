Open the *index.html* file on your favorite browser, and you will see three circle objects created with a random radius, 
three rectangles created with a random length and width, and three squares created with a random length.

*Circle.js* contains the Circle class definition and code to display the circle objects on the html file.

*Rectangle.js* contains the Rectangle class definition and code to display the rectangle objects on the html file.

*Square.js* contains the Square class definition and code to display the square objects on the html file.

***INSTRUCTIONS:***

Let's create shaped objects

1. Define a new class called Circle with appropriate attributes and instantiate a few Circle objects.
	- Write a function called circle_area that returns the area of the object. 
	- Write a function called circle_perimeter that returns the perimeter of the object.
2. Define a new class called Rectangle with appropriate attributes and instantiate a few Rectangle objects.
	- Write a function called rectangle_area that returns the area of the given object.
	- Write a function rectangle_perimeter that returns the perimeter of the object.
3. Define a new class called Square with appropriate attributes and instantiate a few Square objects.
	- Write a function called square_area that returns the area of the given object.
	- Write a function square_perimeter that returns the perimeter of the object.
